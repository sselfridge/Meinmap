- Consolidate dates
    - pick new date library?
- move all strava interaction into strava service
- Pull out 'add activity' logic from queue
    -  Want to be able to call directly when push-sub comes in
    - But preserve the queue process for new users onboarding
        - Allow new users to paste activities but save parsing for night?
- Allow non-premium users to view their leaderboard segments
